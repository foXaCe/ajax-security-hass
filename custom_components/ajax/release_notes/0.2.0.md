## Real-Time Notifications and Binary Sensors

### New Features

#### Real-Time Notification Streaming
- **Instant updates**: Notifications now arrive in real-time via gRPC streaming, eliminating the 30-second polling delay
- **Live event processing**: Motion detection, door openings, and alarm events are now reflected immediately in Home Assistant
- **Background streaming**: Persistent connection maintains real-time updates without impacting performance

#### Binary Sensor Platform
New binary sensor entities for comprehensive device monitoring:
- **Motion sensors**: Detect movement with automatic 30-second reset
- **Door/Window contacts**: Track opening/closing of access points
- **Smoke detectors**: Monitor for fire hazards
- **Leak detectors**: Water/moisture detection
- **Tamper sensors**: Alert when devices are tampered with (disabled by default)

#### Last Alert Sensor
- **Event tracking**: New sensor showing the most recent security event
- **Rich details**: Displays timestamp, device name, room location, and event type
- **Timezone-aware**: Proper UTC timezone handling for accurate timestamps

### Improvements

- **IoT class**: Updated from `cloud_polling` to `cloud_push` for real-time capabilities
- **Timezone handling**: Fixed datetime timezone issues causing Home Assistant warnings
- **French translations**: Complete localization for all new sensors and attributes
- **Auto-reset behavior**: Motion and door sensors automatically clear after 30 seconds, matching physical device behavior

### Technical Changes

- Added `async_stream_notification_updates()` method for real-time notification streaming
- Implemented background task management for notification streams
- Enhanced coordinator to process notification events as they arrive
- Added `_async_process_notification_event()` for instant device state updates
- Proper cleanup of streaming tasks on shutdown

This release transforms the integration from periodic polling to real-time event-driven updates, providing a more responsive and accurate representation of your Ajax security system in Home Assistant.
